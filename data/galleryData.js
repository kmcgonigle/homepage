        "content": "<p>The pattern of this scarf was inspired by Celtic knots found in illuminated manuscripts, and it was a very interesting project &mdash; different from any other knit piece I've made. I basically threw myself into the deep-end of cable knitting and learning to use charts.</p><p>Because it's worked length-wise, the initial cast-on takes a LONG time and requires a lot of double-checking stitch-counts. It was my first time knitting a <em>steek</em> as well.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">In knitting, steeking is a shortcut used to knit garments such as sweaters in the round without interruption for openings or sleeves until the end. After completing a tube, <strong>a straight line is cut</strong> along the center of a column of stitches[...]. The steek itself is a bridge of extra stitches, in which the cut is made, and is usually 6-10 stitches wide. &mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steek\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p><p>That's right! The section of this scarf that becomes the fringe is knit with the sole purpose of being <strong>cut with a scissors at the end</strong>! &#128561 After you cut, you must carefully unravel the ends and then gather and knot them. Knitting this took me the better part of a year, so taking a scissors to it at the end was pretty nerve-wracking, but it all worked out fine.</p><p>If you'd like to try this pattern for yourself, it's available from <a href=\"https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lindisfarne-7\" target=\"_blank\">Lucy Hague on Ravelry</a>.</p>",

I really wanted a \"clippable\" Clipper card, that I could just hook onto my bag or a belt loop, tap and go.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Note: for those not in the Bay Area, a Clipper Card is transit card that can be used for many different area transit services.</p><p>There were a couple sacrificial Clippers that perished before I got the hang of embedding the fragile chip and super-fine wire coil in resin. And this was my first time working with resin as well, so that had a bit of a learning curve!</p><p>I'm still using this as my primary Clipper Card. When reloading it once at Montgomery Station in downtown SF, I had a station operator come over to me to see what I was doing. I really thought I might get in trouble, but instead they just thought it was cool. Phew!  &#128517</p>",

It was on clearance at the time, and I think the reason why was, in part, it was truly a DIY project. It required soldering all the diodes and resistors, and as a bonus, I figured out what type of tiny sockets to buy from Digi-Key to make it hot-swappable.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Hot-swappable keyboards are cool because you don't have to desolder all your key switches if you decide you want to try out a different type of key switch.</p><p>Because it was on clearance, there weren't any premade cases either, so I ordered some material samples from Ponoko and ultimately made a sandwich case with translucent acrylic in the middle and 2 layers of teal on the top and bottom. I modified the design of the top a bit so that the screws could sit flush within the pre-cut holes.</p><p>And after all that, I could plan out my key mappings! Figuring out what sort of key mappings you want is where the rubber meets the road here; if you've never used a mechanical keyboard before, they are <em>fully</em> programmable. <a href=\"https://github.com/kmcgonigle/iris-keyboard-layout\" target=\"_blank\">My Iris mapping</a> is on my personal Github, if you'd like to check it out.</p>",
