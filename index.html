					<p>I've been working professionally as a web developer since 2007 (and have been creating personal websites since the IE6 days!); the act of creating an application from nothing more than characters typed into an editor never ceases to feel like magic.</p>
					<p>While web dev takes up a lot of my time, I love creating all sorts of different projects on the side. I created this site to show a few projects I've done in the recent past.</p>
					<p>If you'd like to chat directly, please feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmcgonigle/" target="_blank">connect with me on LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="mailto:hello@katmcgo.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

				<h2>Career Highlights</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>I've had the good fortune to work for two different ad agencies, crafting digital experiences with all sorts of bells and whistles. I served as the <b>sole developer for a number of sites that were awarded Gold and Silver Birmingham ADDY awards</b> in 2014 and 2015.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>During a total rebrand and platform migration undertaken by my employer at the time, a large corporate bank, I worked closely with our head UX designer to take newly re-branded component designs and translate them into modular component code. At the end, I had <b>created dozens of components documented in a "Playbook" website</b> that I handed over the platform migration team to fully templatize.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Back in the glory days of Flash, I persuaded a client who wanted a slideshow header with complex animation to go with JS animations (using Raphael.js). I was able to make a <b>fully responsive animated slideshow</b> to spec, and the client was quite happy when they could pull it up on their iPhone.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>As the web continues to evolve, I continue to pick up new skills and experiences. I started out in middle school with an <b>Angelfire</b> site, leveled up to creating fully-custom Wordpress templates, and now my day-to-day coding is in <b>React with Redux-Saga and Sass + CSS modules</b>.</p>
