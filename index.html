				<p>I've been working professionally as a web developer since 2007 (and have been creating personal websites since the IE6 days!); the act of creating an application from nothing more than characters typed into an editor never ceases to feel like magic.</p>
				<p>While web dev takes up a lot of my time, I love creating all sorts of different projects on the side. I created this site to show a few projects I've done in the recent past.</p>
				<p>If you'd like to chat directly, please feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmcgonigle/" target="_blank">connect with me on LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="mailto:hello@katmcgo.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

						<h3>Two-color knit scarf, "Lindisfarne"</h3>

						<p>This scarf, whose pattern was inspired by Celtic knots found in illuminated manuscripts, was a very interesting project &mdash; different from any other knit piece I've made. I basically threw myself into the deep-end of cable knitting and using charts.</p>

						<p>Because it's worked length-wise, the initial cast-on takes a LONG time and requires a lot of double-checking stitch-counts. It was my first time knitting a <em>steek</em> as well.</p>

						<p class="pull-quote">In knitting, steeking is a shortcut used to knit garments such as sweaters in the round without interruption for openings or sleeves until the end. After completing a tube, <strong>a straight line is cut</strong> along the center of a column of stitches[...]. The steek itself is a bridge of extra stitches, in which the cut is made, and is usually 6-10 stitches wide. &mdash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steek" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>

						<p>That's right! The section of this scarf that becomes the fringe is knit with the sole purpose of being <strong>cut with a scissors at the end</strong>! &#128561 After you cut, you must carefully unravel the ends and then gather and knot them. Knitting this took me the better part of a year, so taking a scissors to it at the end was pretty nerve-wracking, but it all worked out fine.</p>

						<p>If you'd like to try this pattern for yourself, it's available from <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lindisfarne-7" target="_blank">Lucy Hague on Ravelry</a>.</p>

						<h3>"Magical Girl" Clipper Transit Card</h3>
						<p>This project was inspired by the incredible @sailorhg's <a href="https://twitter.com/sailorhg/status/1110621681452605440" target="_blank">"Seven Rings" Clipper project</a>.</p>
						<p>I was accustomed to fumbling with my Clipper Card daily in crowded buses and trains, digging it out of my wallet and trying to stow it away before the vehicle started moving with a jolt. I really wanted a "clippable" Clipper card, that I could just clip onto my bag or a belt loop, tap and go.</p>
						
						<p>(For those not in the Bay Area, a Clipper Card is transit card that can be used for many different area transit services.)</p>

						<p>There were a couple sacrificial Clippers that perished before I got the hang of embedding the fragile chip and super-fine wire coil in resin. And this was my first time working with resin as well, so that had a bit of a learning curve!</p>

						<p>I'm still using this as my primary Clipper Card. When reloading it once at Montgomery Station in downtown SF, I had a station operator come over to me to see what I was doing. I really thought I might get in trouble, but instead they just thought it was cool. Phew!  &#128517</p>

						<h3>Crochet Cat Couch, with "throw" blanket and pillows</h3>

						<p>Crochet is a hobby I picked up in high school, so at this point I've been at it for a while. But I've never worked with foam, and I also wanted to take the opportunity to learn a new type of crochet, "planned pooling."</p>

						<p class="pull-quote">[Planned pooling] is an exciting technique to get variegated yarns to “pool” the colours so that you get a tartan or harlequin effect. &mdash; <a href="https://thecrochetcrowd.com/planned-pooling-variegated-yarn/" target="_blank">The Crochet Crowd</a></p>

						<p>Using planned pooling, I was able to get a plaid effect on the blanket and a striped effect on the pillows using very specific row counts and tension (but with the exact same yarn on both).</p>

						<p>That was the fun part; the couch itself was a BEAST, requiring way more yarn than I expected. But at least my cat liked it... for the first few days, at least. &#128568</p>

						<h3>Iris Rev. 2 split keyboard with custom cable</h3>
						<p>I hadn't soldered anything in years, but that didn't stop me from buying a keyboard kit from <a href="https://keeb.io/" target="_blank">Keebio</a>, the Iris Rev. 2. It was on clearance at the time, and I think the reason why was, in part, it was truly a DIY project. I soldered the diodes and resistors, and figured out what type of tiny sockets to buy from Digi-Key to make it hot-swappable.</p>

						<p>Because it was on clearance, there weren't any premade cases either, so I ordered some samples from Ponoko and ultimately made a sandwich case with translucent acrylic in the middle and 2 layers of teal on the top and bottom (I modified the design of the top a bit so that the screws could sit flush within the pre-cut holes).</p>

						<p>And after all that, I could plan out my key mappings! Figuring out what sort of key mappings you want is where the rubber meets the road here; if you've never used a mechanical keyboard before, they are <em>fully</em> programmable. <a href="https://github.com/kmcgonigle/iris-keyboard-layout" target="_blank">My Iris mapping</a> is on my personal Github, if you'd like to check it out.</p>

			<h2>Career Highlights</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>I've had the good fortune to work for two different ad agencies, crafting digital experiences with all sorts of bells and whistles. I served as the <b>sole developer for a number of sites that were awarded Gold and Silver Birmingham ADDY awards</b> in 2014 and 2015.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>During a total rebrand and platform migration undertaken by my employer at the time, a large corporate bank, I worked closely with our head UX designer to take newly re-branded component designs and translate them into modular component code. At the end, I had <b>created dozens of components documented in a "Playbook" website</b> that I handed over the platform migration team to fully templatize.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Back in the glory days of Flash, I persuaded a client who wanted a slideshow header with complex animation to go with JS animations (using Raphael.js). I was able to make a <b>fully responsive animated slideshow</b> to spec, and the client was quite happy when they could pull it up on their iPhone.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>As the web continues to evolve, I continue to pick up new skills and experiences. I started out in middle school with an <b>Angelfire</b> site, leveled up to creating fully-custom Wordpress templates, and now my day-to-day coding is in <b>React with Redux-Saga and Sass + CSS modules</b>.</p>
